## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Your PDF must contain fillable form fields (created in Adobe Acrobat, LibreOffice, etc.)
- CSV file must have headers in the first row
- Column names in CSV should not contain special characters for best compatibility
- Generated files are processed entirely in your browser's memory

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**PDF has no form fields detected**
- Ensure your PDF contains actual form fields, not just text placeholders
- Use Adobe Acrobat or similar tools to add form fields

**Mapping overlay doesn't align with PDF**
- The app handles rotated and cropped PDFs automatically
- If issues persist, try re-saving the PDF without rotation

**Browser runs out of memory**
- For very large batches (>1000 PDFs), process in smaller chunks
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory
